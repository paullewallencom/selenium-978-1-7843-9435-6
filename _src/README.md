**Boost the performance and reliability of your automated checks by mastering Selenium WebDriver**

## What is this book about?
The second edition of Mastering Selenium 3.0 WebDriver starts by showing you how to build your own Selenium framework with Maven. You'll then look at how you can solve the difficult problems that you will undoubtedly come across as you start using Selenium in an enterprise environment and learn how to produce the right feedback when failing. Next, you’ll explore common exceptions that you will come across as you use Selenium, the root causes of these exceptions, and how to fix them. Along the way, you’ll use Advanced User Interactions APIs, running any JavaScript you need through Selenium; and learn how to quickly spin up a Selenium Grid using Docker containers. In the concluding chapters, you‘ll work through a series of scenarios that demonstrate how to extend Selenium to work with external libraries and applications so that you can be sure you are using the right tool for the job.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Provide fast, useful feedback with screenshots
* Create extensible, well-composed page objects
* Utilize ChromeDriver and GeckoDriver in headless mode
* Leverage the full power of Advanced User Interactions APIs
* Use JavascriptExecutor to execute JavaScript snippets in the browser through Selenium
